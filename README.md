# Encrypted Chat
## Introduction

The encrypted chat program was created for a university class. The purpose of the project was to learn about encryption, specifically the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the XOR cipher. The source code is here to demostrate my software development skills.

In its current state, the source code will not compile. For ease of development, I plan on using Java. The original project asked for components of Diffie-Hellman to be entered as command line parameters. Due to this, I intend to have the software generate the public and private components.

## Problems
* Original software was created on Linux.
* Project requirements had the user enter the Diffie-Hellman components as command-line paramenters.
* Do not have the original project requirements.

## Goals
* Rewrite in Java
* Implement key exchange and cipher using Java Cryptography Extension.
* Implement Diffie-Hellman and the XOR cipher without the use of external libraries.
* Create AbstractAlgebra and NumberTheory classes to house math functions not specific to cryptography.
* Implement handshake to exchange keys.
