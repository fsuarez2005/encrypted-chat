# Encrypted Chat

## Introduction

The encrypted chat program was created for a university class. The purpose of the project was learn about encryption, specifically the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the XOR cipher. The source code is here to demostrate my software development skills.

In its current, the source code will not compile. Future developments will be in stored in the "development" branch.
