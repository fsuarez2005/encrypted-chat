# Cryptography
## Problems
The original project requests for g and n for Diffie-Hellman and does not calculate them on it's own. Due to the age of the original, I am unsure if the original numbers were provided by the professor. I had sought to create them; however, the math involved was most likely why the professor did not have us generate these on our own.

## Topics of Research
* Abstract Algebra
* Primitive Root Modulo n
 * Algorithms for calculating such
* Multiplicate Group of Integers Modulo n

## Goals
The goal I had set for this project to restore the original project to working state. It was original developed for Linux, but I am working using macos, which is slightly different. The original code is in the repository so it could still be classified as a complete project.

## Plan
In order to save on development time the new plan for encryption in this project is to use the Java Cryptography Extension. Diffie-Hellman is one of the algorithms provided.

I do have interest in developing classes and methods for Number Theory and Abstract Algebra that could be used to for encryption.
